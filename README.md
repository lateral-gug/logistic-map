# logistic-map
Bifurcation, through-time convergence and spiderweb-Moran diagrams implementation for the logistic demographic model. 
Run the script to print the bifurcation diagram for the values of the r parameter in the selected range. Click on the picture to print the through-time convergence and spiderweb-Moran diagrams for that particular value of r and for a randomly chosen initial step x0.
